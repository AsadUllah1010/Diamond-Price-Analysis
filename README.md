# Diamond-Price-Analysis
A diamond is one of the most expensive stones. The price of diamonds varies irrespective of the size because of the factors affecting the price of a diamond.
# Introduction
To analyze the price of diamonds according to their attributes, we first need to have a dataset containing diamond prices based on their features. I found ideal data on Kaggle containing information about diamonds like:
1. Carat
2. Cut
3. Colour
4. Clarity
5. Depth
6. Table
7. Price
8. Size
<br>
I will move to the task of predicting diamond prices by using all the necessary information from the diamond price analysis done above. Before moving forward, I will convert the values of the cut column as the cut type of diamonds is a valuable feature to predict the price of a diamond. To use this column, we need to convert its categorical values into numerical values.

# Conclusion
So this is how you can use your Data Science skills for the task of diamond price analysis and prediction using the Python programming language. According to the diamond price analysis, we can say that the price and size of premium diamonds are higher than other types of diamonds.
